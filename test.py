# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document

## 1. Introduction

The primary objective of this software project is to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based system that can analyze and interpret racing data. This system should be able to process image frames from racing events, use these images to predict certain racing attributes such as speed, position, gear, and lap, and then evaluate the accuracy of these predictions.

## 2. General Description

The software project will include the following main components:

1. Data Preparation and Loading: This includes a dataset class for loading and processing the racing data, including applying necessary transformations.

2. Deep Learning Model: This involves creating a neural network model that can process the input data and make the desired predictions.

3. Training Module: This component will involve training the neural network model on a dataset of racing frames and corresponding target variables.

4. Evaluation Module: This will involve a system to evaluate the model's predictions against the true values from the dataset.

5. Main Execution: The system will also need a main execution script to run the training and evaluation modules and report the results.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

1. The system should be able to read and load racing data from a CSV file and corresponding image frames from a directory.

2. The system should preprocess and transform the data as necessary for input into the neural network model.

3. The system should implement a neural network model capable of predicting the in-race status, speed, position, gear, and lap from the input image data.

4. The system should be capable of training this model on a given dataset, adjusting the model's parameters to minimize prediction error.

5. The system should be capable of evaluating the model's predictions, comparing them to true values and reporting the mean error for speed and accuracy for categorical variables.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:** The system should process the racing data and generate predictions in a reasonable time frame.

2. **Reliability:** The system should produce reliable and reproducible results when run with the same input data and parameters.

3. **Usability:** The system should provide clear outputs that allow users to easily interpret the model's performance.

## 4. Software Environment

The software will be developed in Python, utilizing the PyTorch library for creating and training the neural network model. Additional Python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, and PIL, will be used for data handling and processing. The system should be capable of running on any standard computer with these software dependencies installed. 

## 5. User Interaction

Users will interact with the software by running the Python scripts via the command line, providing the necessary input data and parameters. The software will then output the results of the model training and evaluation, reporting the mean error for speed and accuracy for the predicted categorical variables.

## 6. Conclusion

The software system will provide a valuable tool for analyzing and interpreting racing data. By predicting key racing attributes from image frames, the system can provide insights that may aid in understanding and predicting racing performance.
